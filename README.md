# Clash-of-Clans

This Java project is a simplified simulation inspired by the popular mobile game Clash of Clans. It models various game entities such as troops, heroes, and enemies using object-oriented programming principles. The codebase demonstrates concepts like inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism, providing a foundational structure for simulating interactions between different game characters.
